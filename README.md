## About

The Graph-Based Optimization Modeling Language (GBOML) is a modeling language for mathematical programming enabling the easy implementation of a broad class of structured mixed-integer linear programs typically found in applications ranging from energy system planning to supply chain management. More precisely, the language is particularly well-suited for representing problems involving the optimization of discrete-time dynamical systems over a finite time horizon and possessing a block structure that can be encoded by a hierarchical hypergraph. The language combines elements of both algebraic and object-oriented modeling languages in order to facilitate problem encoding and model re-use, speed up model generation, expose problem structure to specialised solvers and simplify post-processing. The GBOML parser, which is implemented in Python, turns GBOML input files into hierarchical graph data structures representing optimization models. The associated tool provides both a command-line interface and a Python API to construct models, and directly interfaces with a variety of open source and commercial solvers, including structure-exploiting ones.

## Quick start

GBOML has been tested on Windows, macOS and Linux. The simplest way to install it is via the *pip* package manager in a terminal window:

    pip install gboml

Please refer to the online documentation for more [information on how to install GBOML](https://gboml-docs-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). Note that optimization solvers are also required to solve GBOML models and installation instructions are also provided in the online documentation.

Several examples are provided in this repository ([in the examples directory](examples/)) and explained in the [online documentation](https://gboml-docs-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).

## Citing GBOML

An early version of the GBOML framework was introduced in [a recent paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2021.671279/full). GBOML has also been submitted for review to the Journal of Open Source Software.
