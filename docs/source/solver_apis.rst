Solver APIs
-----------

The GBOML parser interfaces with a variety of open source and commercial solvers in order to solve optimization models.
Direct access to their API is provided for several solvers, allowing users to tune algorithm parameters and query complementary information
(e.g., dual variables, slacks or basis ranges, when available).

Solver parameters must be placed in file named *solver_name.opt*. This file must be passed via the *--opt* option of the command-line interface or directly as an argument in the Python API.
More information about solver parameters can typically be found on the website of the respective solver (e.g., for `Gurobi <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/parameters.html>`_).

The list of attributes that may be queried from the different solvers can be found below:

* Gurobi: the following constraint attributes can be queried from the solver: *Pi* (dual variables), *Slack* (slack variables), *CBasis* (whether slack variable is in simplex basis), *SARHSLow* (right-hand side basis sensitivity information), *SARHSUp* (right-hand side basis sensitivity information). In addition, the following variable attributes can be queried (most of them useful for sensitivity  analyses): *RC* (reduced cost), *VBasis*, *SAObjLow*, *SAObjUp*, *SALBLow*, *SALBUp*, *SAUBLow*, *SAUBUp*. More details can be found on the `Gurobi website <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/attributes.html>`_.

* CPLEX: the following constraint attributes can be queried: dual and slack variables. The following variable attributes can be queried: basis information and dual norms.

* Xpress: the following constraint attributes can be queried: dual and slack variables. The following variable attributes can be queried: reduced cost.

* Cbc/Clp: the Cbc/Clp API is still under development with a new interface where multiple parameters can be passed to the solver but no variable attributes can be queried yet.

* Highs: the Highs API is still under development with a new interface where multiple parameters can be passed to the solver but no variable attributes can be queried yet.

Note that all of these attributes are automatically queried and printed in the detailed JSON/CSV file, when requested.
